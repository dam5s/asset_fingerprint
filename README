AssetFingerprint
================
Ruby on Rails plugin to fingerprint asset files using md5 checksum in filenames
to improve cacheability compared to default Rails asset caching strategy.

Originally developed to improve the performance of MissedConnections.com.

Plugin can also be configured to use the default Rails asset caching strategy of 
putting file timestamps in the query string.

Based on guidelines recommended by Google Page Speed here:
http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html

Rails Versions
==============
Tested with Rails 2.2.3 though there's a good chance it'll work with earlier
and newer versions with little or no modification.

HOWTO
=====
Install the plugin at vendor/plugins/asset_fingerprint in your app.

Create a config/initializers/asset_fingerprint.rb file and add these lines:

# config/initializers/asset_fingerprint.rb start
require 'asset_fingerprint/asset_tag_helper'

ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper.asset_fingerprint_strategy = 
  { :fingerprint => :timestamp, :path => :query_string }

# config/initializers/asset_fingerprint.rb end

Change the asset_fingerprint_strategy in this initializer file to suit
your needs. Set :fingerprint to :timestamp and :path to :query_string if
you want the same behaviour that ships with Rails, however, recommended strategy
is { :fingerprint => :md5, :path => :file_name } for maximum cacheability.
